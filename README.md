# Getting-and-Cleaning-data
Course project

The program should be one folder above the actual data folder provided by the project. It will create a tidydata file in the same location as is the location of this program.

It uses features.txt file to identify column names and remove columns having any information other that mean() or Std().

The program works just as is asked for. 
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Create a tidy dataset removing any unwanted information and keeping a neat output.
